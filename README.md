# FAQBot
A Discord Bot that answers FAQs

In order for a member to add a new FAQ, they must send a message formatted in a manner similar to:
Tag## A3 due date ##Question## Did he post the A3 due date? ## Whats the due date for A3?##Whats the deadline for A3?##Response## September 26th

There must be exactly 1 tag and 1 response, and there could be multiple variations of the question.

The user is encouraged to provide as many variations of the question as possible, as it improves the accuracy of the bot.
